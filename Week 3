Unit Testing Plan/cutting points: 

1) Satchel Boundary movement: Fail
    One conceptual test will be seeing if the satchel hits the right wall and bounces off of it. If it does, then the test passes. If the satchel goes past
    the barrier, then will fail and debugging will need to proceed
    Another conceptual test will be if the speed and angle from hitting the boundary is correct. The path of the satchel should be consistent.
2) Artillery movement: Fail
    A conceptual test would be if the slider can move the artillery left and right. Another will be if it stops or bounces off the boundary wall. The 
    artillery needs to be in view at all times and no pieces will be missing. So having it be able to bounce just like the satchel will be beneficial. 
3) Artillery Shield: Fail
    With hitting a button, it will activate the protective shield. If it activates, then we have succeeded. Another test will be if the shield dissapears 
    after a while. Having a set amount of time the shield is active will help show if a test passes.
    
Functional Tests:
1) Blinking Left LED: Fail
    When the castle is hit enough times and you have started evacuation, need to make sure that LED is blinking.
2) Right LED: Fail
    The pressure will show the LED at different birghtness' based on its input time.
3) Speed of rail-gun shot: Fail
    Showing the different speeds of the shot based on the input timer from button
4) Satchel hits floor: Fail
    When the satchel hits the floor, the game will end as the player has lost
5) Always on (satchel): Fail
    Always see a satchel on screen at all tiems
6) Artillery movement: Fail
    Artillery will slow down to a stop when capsense is not being touched 
7) Satchel bounce: Fail
    When the satchel hits the wall, make sure that the horizontal velocity does not change
8) Shot comes out from the barrell of rail gun: Fail
    Make sure the shot comes out of the barrell and no where else
9) Rail gun and artillery move together: Fail
    When moving the artillery, make sure that the rail gun moves with it
10) Satchel physics: Fail
     Make sure the parabola of the satchel makes sense and follows a correct path logically
    
    
Statement where project stands: This week the tasks were created and relevant functions were implemented but not functionable at the moment. I added one
                                iten to the risk register and changed some of the risk levels on some as I have gained more information on how to implement
                                them and able to get them mitigated. I added functional tests to eventually test out when I can get some working functions
                                in the project. The project will hopefully show a partially working project by next week. 
                                
Summary effort:  I was able to complete 33% of my estimated work in 58% (7/12 hours) of of my initially estimated time. I took 1.75x (7/4) more time as I
                 estimated that it would take. 
                           

In-Scope work items:
Basics of LCD Screen 
Incomplete
Total time: 7 hours
Managing on how to implement the castle and artillery as well as the movements of each aspect that needs to be presented on the screen.

Satchel movement
Incomplete
Total time: 6 hours
I will need to be able to find calculations and projections of the satchel movement based on its location on the screen. Either if it needs to bounce off 
a wall or just arching down with different speeds. Including if it reaches the artillery or the floor or even the protective shield.

LED blinking
Incomplete
Total Time: 3 hours
The LED will need to blink in order for the evacuation and as well show the LED based on brightness, show the power that was inputted by the user. 

Artillery movements
Incomplete
Total Time: 5 hours
Have the Artillery and platform move based on where the capsense is being pressed. There will be some adjustments and different speeds that will be 
needed to be implemented in order to provide this functionality, including if it hits the edges. 

Button pressed/capsense slider
Incomplete
Total Time: 5 hours
Make sure there is a priority between these tasks and have the LCD screen show accordingly of what is being pressed. Make sure that the inputs cooperate
with the user.

Data storage
Incomplete
Total Time: 10 hours
There will be plenty of data to be managed from time and movement/placement in order for everything to run. This will give a sense of reality when things 
align correctly. As well as task priority and how long something has been pressed or if the castle has been damaged enough to go into the next sequence 
(task) of the game. This will also include physics that will be implemented throughout the entire project.

Beginning/End screen
Incomplete
Total Time: 2 hours
Having a title and ending screen to show when the game can begin and when the game has ended.
